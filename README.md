Homeridge Plugin for Automations Triggering

## Why

Devices within HomeKit newtwork can trigger actions - switches, motion and security sensors, thermostats.
These are value triggers including: power, brightness, contact, temperature, humidity, heating mode, battery level and so on.

Unfortunately custom values can not be used as triggers - "Turn the lights off when power consumption exceeds 100w".
But they can be used as trigger conditions! So you can make a rule like "Turn the lights off when the temperature changes its value and power consumption exceeds 100w".

It looks quite trashy and inreliable - if the temperature value does not change - the rule is not executed.

## How

This is more like a hack to overcome the limitation of HomeKit not able to trigger actions on custom values. It works like that:

* Add a fake contact sensor that automatically triggers every n-seconds
* Make a rule "Turn the lights off when FakeTrigger changes state and power consumption exceeds 100w"

Lets set n to 60 seconds and HomeKit will run your rule every minute.

Now the cons. Need to check the impact on the iPhone's battery as it's where HomeKit lives (if you don't have an Apple TV).
Even with Apple TV not sure if it doesn't make you phone process the trigger every single time (hope it doesn't)
Upd: after 3 months of usage I did not notice any battery lifetime change.

## Configuration

Install homebridge-trigger plugin and add accessories to your config.json `accessories` section. Example:

```json
"accessories": [
        {
          "accessory": "FakeTriggerMatcha",
          "name": "Trigger every 60 sec",
          "interval": 60
          "name2": "Trigger every hour",
          "interval2": 3600
        }
    ]
```

Min interval value is set to 60 seconds in order not to flood HomeKit with too many requests
